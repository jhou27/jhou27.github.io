My name is Jinghua Ou (pronouns she/her/hers). I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Chicago in the <a href="https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a>. My research program seeks to understand the dynamics of language at multiple levels from three inter-related perspectives – how language changes and varies, how language is processed ‘online’, and how language is learned. My research is guided by the principle that there is a unified framework to integrate our understanding of language dynamics at the level of the individual with the level of community/society. Particularly, I focus on language dynamics at the interface between phonetic forms and phonological representations. My research employs a variety of methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG at the subcortical and cortical level), eye-tracking, psycholinguistic experiments and acoustic measurements.

I received my PhD in Speech and Hearing Sciences from the <a href="https://web.edu.hku.hk/unit/human-communication-development-and-information-sciences/">University of Hong Kong</a>. Prior to joining UChicago, I was a Postdoc Fellow in the <a href="http://bmi.cuhk.edu.hk/">Brain & Mind Institute</a> at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. </p>
