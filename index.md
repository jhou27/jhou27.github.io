  My name is <i>Jinghua Ou</i> (pronouns she/her/hers). I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Chicago in the <a href="https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/">Department of Linguistics</a>. My research focuses on a fundamental mechanism in human behavior: <strong>How do we perceive the speech signal in order to map it to meaning?</strong> This basic mechanism is essential in understanding language processing across multiple timescales â€“ how language in processed in realtime, how language is learned over time, and more broadly, how language changes and varies across lifespan. Through the use of a variety of methodologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking, psycholinguistic and acoustic measurements, I characterize the range of individual variations in speech processing as a means to enhancing our mechanistic understanding of the computations we perform during speech processing, and the neurocognitive factors that can affect these processes.Please visit my <a href="https://jhou27.github.io/research">research</a> for more information! <br><br>
  
I received my PhD in Speech and Hearing Sciences from the <a href="https://web.edu.hku.hk/unit/human-communication-development-and-information-sciences/">University of Hong Kong</a>. Prior to joining UChicago, I was a Postdoc Fellow in the <a href="http://bmi.cuhk.edu.hk/">Brain & Mind Institute</a> at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. </p>
