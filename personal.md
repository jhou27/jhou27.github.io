I grew up in the city of Foshan (佛山) in southern China, where Martial Arts and Wing Chun are originated and flourished (unfortunately I master none). Southern China has the greatest Cantonese-speaking population, so naturally I speak Cantonese as my mother tongue. I then learned Mandarin and subsequently English in School. As a speaker constantly switching between languages, I think a lot about how languages influence thoughts and, how thoughts are (dis)similarly represented in different languages. <br><br>

In 2012, I moved to Hong Kong and had lived in this international metropolis for 7 years. The diverse cultural and linguistic landscape in HK has inspired my research and transformed my frame of thought about language and cognition in the larger context of culture and society. In 2018, I moved to the US and have lived in Chicago since. <br><br>

Outside of research, I enjoy a lot of outdoor activities, particularly hiking, tennis and skiing. I recently became a dog owner (first time in my life!) and have been spending wonderful times with Niku the golden retriever:) </p>
